# DataScience_Assignment3
In this project, we aim to compare a couple machine learning models that predict the
relevance of search results on HomeDepot.com. The Home Depot dataset, sourced from
Kaggle, contains various features such as search queries, product titles, descriptions, and
relevance scores assigned by human raters. We will explore the dataset, preprocess the data,
engineer features, experiment with different models and methods, and evaluate our approach
using suitable metrics. We will be comparing our results from the previous assignment to
some new results obtained from optimizing a couple other models which were not discussed
previously. By conducting this analysis, we aim to determine which model performs the best
on the Home Depot dataset, providing insights into the effectiveness of various supervised
learning regression models for predicting search result relevance.
